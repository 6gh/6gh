# hi
im 6gh

i code mostly random stuff. most of my repos are private due to them being very old and they're irrelevant to what i code now

i have experience with coding discord bots, so most of those projects are countless discord bots. but now i am moving to making small useful programs and tools to help me or others with various tasks. and the bot whose invite link used to be here is sort of abandoned. I am not actively working on Qwertyy as i have lost drive on making discord bots, but whos knows i might make one again in the future

i am starting to like having my repos open to the public because i firmly believe in the power of Open-Source and the community.

please check out my pinned repos for the 2 newest projects i've created (both for Black MIDI due to my history as a blacker (and the fact a lot of my friends are blackers)). 

if you know about the midi format, help me out with understanding it since i want to learn more about it but i cant wrap my head around it at the moment. so i'd appreciate it if you can help me out

the main way to contact me is by Discord at 6gh#7369

anyway thanks for reading!
