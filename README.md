# hi
im 6gh (ðŸ§±)

I am a JavaScript/TypeScript developer, mostly focusing on web development (mostly backend but I do frontend work too). A majority of my repos are privated because they are from old projects that aren't relevant to what I do now.

I have experience with other languages, such as c#, python, go, rust, etc, although I really havent used it enough to do anything huge with it. I've used JavaScript the most and am most comfortable with it, hence why I always use JavaScript by default. After all, "any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript" - Atwood's law.

Contact me by Discord: @6gh (say hi or anything you'd like!)

Anyway, thanks for reading!
