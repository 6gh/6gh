# hi
im 6gh

i code mostly random stuff. most of my repos are private due to them being very old and they're irrelevant to what i code now

i have experience with coding discord bots, so most of those projects are countless discord bots. but now i am moving to making small useful programs and tools to help me or others with various tasks. and the bot whose invite link used to be here is sort of abandoned. I am not actively working on Qwertyy as i have lost drive on making discord bots, but whos knows i might make one again in the future

the main way to contact me is by Discord at @6gh

anyway thanks for reading!
